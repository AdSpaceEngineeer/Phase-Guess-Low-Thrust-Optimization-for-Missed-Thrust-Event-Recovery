# This code creates for a flyby mission facing an unforeseen missed thrust event 
# a low fidelity optimized solution space of 
# ballistic time (engines cut off), recovery time (engines back on) 
# and fuel consumption (over recovery trajectory)
# which can be used by a mission designer to choose a small subset of time of flight
# within which a fixed-time high fidelity optimization can be run.
